# TrimAnalyser

PB proof trimmer for the Glasgow Subgraph Isomorphism Solver. Reads `.opb` + `.pbp` proof pairs, extracts the minimal proof cone, optionally re-solves on the UNSAT core to shrink the problem further, and writes `.smol.opb` + `.smol.pbp` output files.

---

## Prerequisites

- Julia 1.10+
- [`DataStructures.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl) (installed automatically via `Pkg`)
- Glasgow Subgraph Solver binary (only needed for `solve`/`resolv` modes)
- VeriPB (only needed for `verif` mode)

---

## Setup

Instantiate the package once to download dependencies:

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

---

## Configuration

Four environment variables control the external tool and data paths. The built-in defaults cover Arthur's laptop and the Glasgow cluster; anyone else sets the relevant variables in their shell config:

```bash
# path to the glasgow_subgraph_solver binary (needed for solve/resolv)
export GLASGOW_SUBGRAPH_SOLVER=/path/to/glasgow_subgraph_solver

# path to the VeriPB binary (needed for verif)
export VERIPB=/path/to/veripb

# base directory — proofs/ subdirectory and output.log are written here
export TRIMNALYSER_BASE=/path/to/working/dir/

# benchmark graph directory — only needed for allgraphs mode
export TRIMNALYSER_GRAPHS=/path/to/benchmarks/
```

Unset variables fall back to the compiled-in defaults. You only need to set the ones that differ from the defaults.

---

## Invocation

```bash
./trimnalyser [julia-flags...] [trimnalyser-flags...] [instance | proofs_dir]
```

The shell wrapper auto-detects a sysimage and handles project activation — no `--project` needed. Pass Julia flags like `--threads` before trimnalyser flags:

```bash
./trimnalyser --threads 8,1 LVg10g12 resolv
```

---

## Workflows

### 1 — Trim a single instance

Proof files must exist at `<proofs_dir>/<instance>.opb` and `<proofs_dir>/<instance>.pbp`.

```bash
./trimnalyser LVg10g12
```

By default the proofs directory is `<abspath>/proofs/`. Pass an explicit directory as any argument that `isdir()` returns true for:

```bash
./trimnalyser /path/to/proofs/ LVg10g12
```

Output: `LVg10g12.smol.opb` + `LVg10g12.smol.pbp` in the proofs directory.

Re-trim even if `.smol` files already exist:

```bash
./trimnalyser LVg10g12 overwrite
```

### 2 — Trim + UNSAT-core re-solve loop (`resolv`)

```bash
./trimnalyser LVg10g12 resolv
./trimnalyser LVg10g12 overwrite resolv   # re-run from scratch
```

Implies `core`. Requires the Glasgow solver binary at the configured path.

#### How the loop works

After trimming the original proof, the trimmer extracts which pattern and target nodes actually appear in the cone (the UNSAT core). It then writes a reduced LAD graph containing only those nodes and re-runs the solver on it. Because the input is smaller, the new proof is often shorter and itself more trimmable. The loop repeats until the extracted core stops shrinking.

Concretely, for `LVg10g12`:

```
trim LVg10g12
  → vis/LVg10g12.pat.dot/.svg      full original graph, core nodes in green
  → vis/LVg10g12.tar.dot/.svg
  → vis/LVg10g12.core.pat.lad      induced subgraph on core nodes (input to next solver run)
  → vis/LVg10g12.core.tar.lad

run solver on core.lad → LVg10g12.core1.opb + .pbp
trim LVg10g12.core1
  → vis/LVg10g12.core1.pat.dot/.svg    core1 graph, with its own trimmed core in green
  → vis/LVg10g12.core1.tar.dot/.svg
  → vis/LVg10g12.core1.core.pat.lad   input to next solver run
  → vis/LVg10g12.core1.core.tar.lad

run solver on core1.core.lad → LVg10g12.core2.opb + .pbp
trim LVg10g12.core2
  → vis/LVg10g12.core2.*
  ...
```

**`coreN`** is the proof generated at iteration N; its input graph was the core extracted from iteration N−1's proof. The `.pat.dot` at each step shows that iteration's input graph with the nodes needed by the *next* trim highlighted in green — so the green region shrinks monotonically as the loop converges.

**Fixpoint:** the loop stops when the newly extracted core has the same node count as the core it was given. The terminal `.core.pat.lad` is deleted at that point. "fixpoint after 0 iterations" means the original proof's core covers the full graph — the solver was never re-run.

### 3 — Run the solver first, then trim (`solve`)

When proof files do not exist yet (fresh instance): run the solver to generate the proof, then trim it.

```bash
./trimnalyser LVg10g12 solve
./trimnalyser LVg10g12 solve resolv   # solve + resolv loop
```

### 4 — Trim all instances in a directory (batch mode)

Omit the instance name to run on every `.opb`/`.pbp` pair in the proofs directory:

```bash
./trimnalyser --threads 8,1 /path/to/proofs/
```

Each instance is spawned as a separate subprocess (`julia -t1,1 ...`) so GC heaps are fully isolated. The outer `--threads N` controls how many subprocesses run in parallel.

Useful batch flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `rand` | Shuffle instance order |
| `sort` | Sort by proof file size (ascending) |
| `overwrite` | Re-trim instances that already have `.smol` files |
| `verif` | Run VeriPB to verify each trimmed output |
| `maxnodes=N` | Skip instances where either graph has more than N nodes |
| `maxmem=N` | OOM-kill subprocesses exceeding N GB (default: 8 on laptop, 50 on cluster) |
| `minmem=N` | Pause spawning new jobs when free RAM drops below N GB |
| `st=N` | Solver timeout in seconds (default: 5) |
| `tt=N` | Trim subprocess timeout in seconds (default: 45) |

### 5 — Full cluster run (enumerate all benchmark pairs)

Generates all `(pattern, target)` pairs from the benchmark graph directories, solves and trims each:

```bash
./trimnalyser --threads 192,1 solve resolv verif allgraphs maxnodes=3000 st=180 tt=6000 rand maxmem=50
```

`allgraphs` reads graph files from the directory set by `TRIMNALYSER_GRAPHS`.

## Aggregating results

After a batch run, aggregate all `.out` files into a CSV:

```bash
julia scripts/aggregate_results.jl /path/to/proofs/ cluster_results.csv
```

## Analysing results

Install script dependencies once per machine (generates `scripts/Manifest.toml`):

```bash
julia --project=scripts -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

Quick terminal statistics (step types, depth distribution, resolv shrinkage):

```bash
julia --project=scripts scripts/quick_stats.jl cluster_results.csv
```

M3 proof survey — family-stratified HTML report. Pass both CSVs to include
graph-feature correlations:

```bash
julia scripts/graph_features.jl /path/to/proofs/ graph_features.csv
julia --project=scripts scripts/proof_survey.jl cluster_results.csv graph_features.csv proof_survey.html
```

---

## Faster startup with a sysimage (optional)

On machines with fast disk I/O (cluster NVMe, RAM-backed tmpfs), a sysimage eliminates per-process JIT cost and is most valuable in batch mode where hundreds of subprocesses start in parallel. `build_sysimage.jl` detects staleness automatically (checks mtimes of all `src/` files):

```bash
julia --project=. build_sysimage.jl
```

The wrapper `./trimnalyser` picks up `trimnalyser.so` automatically if it exists — no flags needed.

> **Note:** `PackageCompiler` must be installed globally (`julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("PackageCompiler")'`).

---

## Running tests

```bash
julia --project=. test/runtests.jl
```

Runs two integration tests against the instances bundled in `test/instances/`: a fast trim-only run on `LVg400g500` and a full resolv+verif run on `LVg10g12`. The verif assertion is skipped silently if VeriPB is not installed.
